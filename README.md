This project presents a comprehensive data story built using **Tableau**, completed as part of the **BUDT 758D: Data Visualization and Web Analytics** course at the University of Maryland.  
The goal was to transform raw development data into meaningful insights through **four dashboards**, combining interactivity, storytelling, and clear visual design.

## Project Overview

The project tells a visual story about **global development trends**, exploring how different factors â€” such as education, GDP, energy, and disaster impact â€” influence economic and human progress across regions.

The Tableau story is composed of **four dashboards**:
1. **Interactive Dashboard 1:** Enables users to explore data dynamically using parameters and filters.  
2. **Interactive Dashboard 2:** Provides deeper insights with linked charts and numerical indicators.  
3. **Analytical Dashboard:** Focused on comparing key development indicators across time and countries.  
4. **Summary & Recommendations Dashboard:** Text-based overview explaining the insights, conclusions, and actionable recommendations derived from the visualizations.

## Tools and Techniques

- **Tool:** Tableau  
- **Skills Demonstrated:**
  - Storyboarding and multi-dashboard linking  
  - Parameter controls and user interactivity  
  - Dynamic filters and cross-chart highlighting  
  - Clear labeling and color encoding for visual clarity  
  - Dashboard storytelling with annotations and summaries

## Story Highlights

### ðŸ”¹ Dashboard 1 â€“ Overview of Global Development
- Interactive world map displaying GDP, literacy, and population by country.  
- Dynamic filters for region and year.  
- Summary metrics showing top/bottom 5 countries.  

### ðŸ”¹ Dashboard 2 â€“ Trends and Correlations
- Interactive line and scatter plots exploring relationships (e.g., GDP vs education).  
- Parameter-driven chart switching (e.g., literacy rate vs energy access).  
- Hover actions revealing country-specific trends.

### ðŸ”¹ Dashboard 3 â€“ Impact Analysis
- Bar charts and heatmaps illustrating how disasters or social factors influence development.  
- Highlighted regions show economic recovery patterns.  

### ðŸ”¹ Dashboard 4 â€“ Summary and Recommendations
- A text-based dashboard summarizing the story:  
  - Key findings from each visualization  
  - Data insights and policy recommendations  
  - Suggested directions for further analysis

## Data Description

The dataset integrates multiple global indicators, such as:
- GDP per capita (World Bank)  
- Literacy rate and education spending  
- COâ‚‚ emissions and energy usage  
- Population and regional aggregates  
- Disaster impact indicators (injuries, deaths, homelessness)  

These datasets were combined and visualized to uncover **patterns of growth, inequality, and resilience** across nations.
